# üêç SnakeVortex - Multiplayer Snake Arena

## About

I've created SnakeVortex, a multiplayer snake game that brings the classic gameplay to the web with real-time multiplayer capabilities. This is a fully-featured snake arena where players compete against each other and intelligent AI bots in a dynamic environment. ***This is my first time working with AI bots and on such a game in general, so don't hit me too hard)***
